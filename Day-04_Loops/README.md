# 30_Days_of_JavaScript_Challenge

# Day 4 :-

Feature Request:

    1. Number Printing Script: Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.

    2. Multiplication Table Script: Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

    3. Pattern Printing Script: Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.

    4. Sum Calculation Script: Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

    5. Factorial Calculation Script: Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

By the end of these activities, I will:
 
    -- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

    -- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.

    -- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.

    -- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.

    -- Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
